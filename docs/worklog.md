- Created `DictaSystemTrayIcon` class with placeholder icon
- Added basic system tray menu with quit functionality
- Set up proper Python package structure with `__init__.py` files
- Created and fixed unit tests for the system tray functionality

## 2024-03-15 14:20 PST - Icon Improvements
- Implemented a visible microphone icon using QPainter
- Made the icon larger (64x64) and added thicker lines for better visibility
- Added proper antialiasing for smoother icon rendering
- Implemented color states (red/yellow/green) for different application states
- Hidden dock icon on macOS for a cleaner menu bar only application
- All tests passing

## 2024-03-15 14:30 PST - Command Execution Safety
- Added note about command execution safety
- For long-running/indefinite commands like the main application, we should wrap them with a timeout
- Example: `timeout 5s PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:. python3 app/desktop_ui/main.py`
- This prevents accidentally leaving processes running in the background
- Particularly important for:
  - Main application testing
  - Integration tests that might hang
  - Any background services or daemons
- Next steps:
  - Update test.sh and start.sh scripts to include appropriate timeouts
  - Add timeout wrapper to CI/CD pipeline commands
  - Document timeout values in README.md

## 2024-03-15 14:35 PST - Improved Process Management
- Fixed timeout handling in the application
- Added proper signal handlers for SIGTERM and SIGINT
- Implemented clean shutdown when timeout occurs
- Added QTimer to ensure signals are processed in Qt's event loop
- Corrected timeout command syntax: `PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:. timeout 5s python3 app/desktop_ui/main.py`
- Application now gracefully shuts down after timeout
- Logs show proper termination sequence

Next steps:
- Add voice detection mode toggle to the menu
- Set up configuration file structure
- Implement push-to-talk functionality

## 2024-03-15 14:40 PST - Dock Icon Hiding Solution
- Successfully implemented proper dock icon hiding on macOS using multiple approaches:
  1. Set Qt application attributes:
     ```python
     app.setAttribute(Qt.ApplicationAttribute.AA_DontUseNativeMenuBar)
     app.setProperty('_q_styleSheetAppFont', True)
     ```
  2. Disabled window tabbing:
     ```python
     os.environ['QT_MAC_DISABLE_WINDOWTABBING'] = '1'
     ```
  3. Used PyObjC to set proper macOS activation policy:
     ```python
     from Foundation import NSApplication
     NSApplication.sharedApplication().setActivationPolicy_(1)  # NSApplicationActivationPolicyAccessory
     ```
- Key points:
  - Application now runs properly as a menu bar only app
  - No dock icon appears
  - System tray icon remains visible and functional
  - Clean shutdown works with timeout command for testing
  - All functionality preserved (menu, icon color changes)

Next steps:
- Add voice detection mode toggle to the menu

  - Type checking for configuration values
  - Validation of configuration sections
  - Graceful handling of missing/corrupt config files
- Created comprehensive test suite:

## 2024-03-15 Voice Activity Detection (VAD) Implementation

### Fixed VAD Tests and Frame Handling

Fixed issues with the WebRTC VAD implementation and tests:

- Identified and fixed frame size requirements for WebRTC VAD:
  - Each frame must be exactly 30ms at 16kHz = 480 samples = 960 bytes
  - Implemented proper frame size validation and padding/truncation

- Improved voice detection:
  - Now using sequences of frames instead of repeating single frames
  - Lowered RMS threshold from 0.8 to 0.5 for better speech detection
  - Added more detailed logging for debugging VAD behavior

- Test improvements:
  - Created fixtures for sequences of voice and silence frames
  - Added frame size verification
  - Improved test readability with better logging
  - All VAD tests now passing

Key learnings:
- WebRTC VAD requires exact frame sizes (10, 20, or 30ms)
- Using sequences of frames provides more natural speech/silence transitions
- Proper frame size handling is crucial for reliable VAD operation
